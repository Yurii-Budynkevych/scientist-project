            Stellar ages are key for determining the formation history of the Milky Way, but are
            difficult to measure precisely. Furthermore, methods that use chemical abundances to
            infer ages may entangle the intrinsic evolution of stars with the chemodynamical
            evolution of the Galaxy. In this paper, we present a framework for making probabilistic
            predictions of stellar ages, and then quantify the contribution of both stellar
            evolution and Galactic chemical evolution to those predictions using SHAP values. We
            apply this interpretable prediction framework to both a simulated Milky Way sample
            containing stars in a variety of evolutionary stages and an APOGEE-mocked sample of red
            clump stars. We find that in the former case, stellar evolution is the dominant driver
            for age estimates, while in the latter case, the more restricted evolutionary
            information causes the model to proxy ages through the chemical evolution model. We show
            that as a result of the use of non-intrinsic Galactic chemical information, trends
            estimated with the predicted ages, such as the age-metallicity relation, can deviate
            from the truth.

            Measuring the chronochemodynamics of stars allows us to reconstruct a timeline of events
            in the Galaxy. Of particular importance are stellar ages; good measurements of stellar
            ages are necessary to understand stellar evolution and the formation history of the
            Milky Way, and to identify new stellar populations within the Galaxy (Mackereth et al.
            2019; Lu et al. 2021b,a; Ness et al. 2019; Aguirre et al. 2018). However, stellar ages
            are particularly difficult to measure, as they are not directly related to any
            observable (see Soderblom 2010 for a review). Instead, we can only measure properties
            that are correlated with ages. For example, ages can be Corresponding author: Jeff Shen
            shenjeff@princeton.edu obtained using gyrochronology (e.g., Barnes 2003; Angus et al.
            2019) uses the empirical relation between a star’s rotation period and its age, and
            asteroseismology (e.g., Lebreton & Montalban 2008; Aguirre et al. 2018), which uses
            measurements of oscillation frequencies to probe the properties of the interiors of
            stars, which are related to age. With the advent of surveys like APOGEE (Majewski et al.
            2017), measurements of many stellar surface properties are available, and they can be
            used to infer ages. Surface properties like log g and Teff describe stellar type, so
            they can be used in conjunction with theoretical stellar evolution models to get
            information about the age of a star (Bressan et al. 2012; Degl’Innocenti 2016; Choi et
            al. 2016). Stellar evolution also changes surface abundances through physical processes
            like dredge-up, whereby CNO products (nitrogen-rich and carbon-poor) are mixed into the
            atmosphere of a star through convecarXiv:2305.15634v1 [astro-ph.GA] 25 May 2023 2 Shen
            et al. tion. The CNO process is also mass dependent, and as a result, abundance ratios
            like [C/N] can give insight into stellar evolution and be used to estimate ages (Salaris
            et al. 2015). Thus, information about stellar evolution (i.e., age) is also correlated
            with [Fe/H], [α/Fe], and other chemical abundances (Nissen et al. 2017; Casali et al.
            2019). However, measured stellar abundances also depend on the material that a star was
            formed from; chemical properties of the interstellar medium vary across time and
            location within the Galaxy (Spina et al. 2016; Mena et al. 2019; Ness et al. 2019). For
            example, Nissen et al. (2017) find for Kepler LEGACY stars in the Galactic disk that
            [Mg/Fe] is correlated with age because the deposition of iron into the ISM from SNIa is
            delayed relative to the production of Mg from SNII. Thus, ages that are inferred from
            certain chemical abundances are entangled with Galactic chemical evolution. For
            understanding the properties of stars and obtaining age estimates that are as precise as
            possible, it may make sense to use as much information as is available. However, to
            understand the assembly history of the Galaxy, it is ideal to have ages that are derived
            from information intrinsic to a star—Galactic information should be removed. The primary
            contribution of this paper is to introduce a framework for making probabilistic
            predictions of the ages of stars. Here we use the Galactic information in the form of
            [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H] as well as stellar information in the form of [Fe/H], log g and Teff.
            We then quantify how much age information comes from Galactic vs stellar models. We
            introduce the methods used to do so—probabilistic random forests and SHapley Additive
            exPlanations—and demonstrate the framework’s potential by applying it to a simple but
            realistic simulation of Milky Way stars. We show that the model predictions are driven
            primarily by stellar evolution information, and as a result, we are able to make robust
            and interpretable predictions that reproduce expected trends in the data. In Section 6
            we repeat our analysis using a sample of APOGEE-mocked red clump stars. This is a harder
            test case because the stars in the sample have very similar log g values, as red clump
            stars lie in a small cluster on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Since log g is be
            almost the same for all stars in that sample, we expect much less information to be
            present in the stellar models than for the Milky Way sample. Thus, the models may need
            to obtain age information by proxying through chemical correlations, which are not
            intrinsic to the star itself. We show that this is indeed the case, and discuss some
            implications of this result. We also make an attempt to explicitly decorrelate the
            chemical information from the age information, and show how that process affects our
            results. We note, however, that observers typically use [C/N] ratios rather than log g
            and Teff to determine ages (e.g., Salaris et al. 2015; Martig et al. 2016; Ho et al.
            2017; Casali et al. 2019). In a follow-up paper, we will extend our framework to
            directly use stellar spectra rather than stellar parameters and abundances estimated
            from the spectra. The layout of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we describe our
            data and the underlying Galactic and stellar models. In Section 3 we explain the
            probabilistic random forest regression model which we use to make probabilistic age
            predictions. In Section 4 we explain SHAP values, which allow us to quantify the
            relative importance of certain features in our predictive models, and then use them to
            determine the relative importance of features in our predictive model. In Section 5 we
            discuss how well the models are able to reproduce simulated age-abundance trend in the
            Galaxy, as a function of (1) choice of age estimator, (2) metallicity, and (3) whether
            there are chemical correlations. In Section 6 we apply our framework to a harder test
            case of red clump stars where the model proxies age information using chemical
            correlations, and compare the results to those obtained from the Milky Way sample. A
            summary of our findings is presented in Section.

            stars, which are related to age. With the advent of surveys like APOGEE (Majewski et al.
            2017), measurements of many stellar surface properties are available, and they can be
            used to infer ages. Surface properties like log g and Teff describe stellar type, so
            they can be used in conjunction with theoretical stellar evolution models to get
            information about the age of a star (Bressan et al. 2012; Degl’Innocenti 2016; Choi et
            al. 2016). Stellar evolution also changes surface abundances through physical processes
            like dredge-up, whereby CNO products (nitrogen-rich and carbon-poor) are mixed into the
            atmosphere of a star through convecarXiv:2305.15634v1 [astro-ph.GA] 25 May 2023 2 Shen
            et al. tion. The CNO process is also mass dependent, and as a result, abundance ratios
            like [C/N] can give insight into stellar evolution and be used to estimate ages (Salaris
            et al. 2015). Thus, information about stellar evolution (i.e., age) is also correlated
            with [Fe/H], [α/Fe], and other chemical abundances (Nissen et al. 2017; Casali et al.
            2019). However, measured stellar abundances also depend on the material that a star was
            formed from; chemical properties of the interstellar medium vary across time and
            location within the Galaxy (Spina et al. 2016; Mena et al. 2019; Ness et al. 2019). For
            example, Nissen et al. (2017) find for Kepler LEGACY stars in the Galactic disk that
            [Mg/Fe] is correlated with age because the deposition of iron into the ISM from SNIa is
            delayed relative to the production of Mg from SNII. Thus, ages that are inferred from
            certain chemical abundances are entangled with Galactic chemical evolution. For
            understanding the properties of stars and obtaining age estimates that are as precise as
            possible, it may make sense to use as much information as is available. However, to
            understand the assembly history of the Galaxy, it is ideal to have ages that are derived
            from information intrinsic to a star—Galactic information should be removed. The primary
            contribution of this paper is to introduce a framework for making probabilistic
            predictions of the ages of stars. Here we use the Galactic information in the form of
            [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H] as well as stellar information in the form of [Fe/H], log g and Teff.
            We then quantify how much age information comes from Galactic vs stellar models. We
            introduce the methods used to do so—probabilistic random forests and SHapley Additive
            exPlanations—and demonstrate the framework’s potential by applying it to a simple but
            realistic simulation of Milky Way stars. We show that the model predictions are driven
            primarily by stellar evolution information, and as a result, we are able to make robust
            and interpretable predictions that reproduce expected trends in the data. In Section 6
            we repeat our analysis using a sample of APOGEE-mocked red clump stars. This is a harder
            test case because the stars in the sample have very similar log g values, as red clump
            stars lie in a small cluster on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Since log g is be
            almost the same for all stars in that sample, we expect much less information to be
            present in the stellar models than for the Milky Way sample. Thus, the models may need
            to obtain age information by proxying through chemical correlations, which are not
            intrinsic to the star itself. We show that this is indeed the case, and discuss some
            implications of this result. We also make an attempt to explicitly decorrelate the
            chemical information from the age information, and show how that process affects our
            results. We note, however, that observers typically use [C/N] ratios rather than log g
            and Teff to determine ages (e.g., Salaris et al. 2015; Martig et al. 2016; Ho et al.
            2017; Casali et al. 2019). In a follow-up paper, we will extend our framework to
            directly use stellar spectra rather than stellar parameters and abundances estimated
            from the spectra. The layout of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we describe our
            data and the underlying Galactic and stellar models. In Section 3 we explain the
            probabilistic random forest regression model which we use to make probabilistic age
            predictions. In Section 4 we explain SHAP values, which allow us to quantify the
            relative importance of certain features in our predictive models, and then use them to
            determine the relative importance of features in our predictive model. In Section 5 we
            discuss how well the models are able to reproduce simulated age-abundance trend in the
            Galaxy, as a function of (1) choice of age estimator, (2) metallicity, and (3) whether
            there are chemical correlations. In Section 6 we apply our framework to a harder test
            case of red clump stars where the model proxies age information using chemical
            correlations, and compare the results to those obtained from the Milky Way sample. A
            summary of our findings is presented in Section.

            Measuring the chronochemodynamics of stars allows us to reconstruct a timeline of events
            in the Galaxy. Of particular importance are stellar ages; good measurements of stellar
            ages are necessary to understand stellar evolution and the formation history of the
            Milky Way, and to identify new stellar populations within the Galaxy (Mackereth et al.
            2019; Lu et al. 2021b,a; Ness et al. 2019; Aguirre et al. 2018). However, stellar ages
            are particularly difficult to measure, as they are not directly related to any
            observable (see Soderblom 2010 for a review). Instead, we can only measure properties
            that are correlated with ages. For example, ages can be Corresponding author: Jeff Shen

            We would like to examine whether the models are able to accurately reproduce
            age-abundance trends in the data. In Figure 8, we show the age-abundance trends for the
            Milky Way sample. On the x-axes, we show the age of the star, and on the y-axes, we show
            the [Mg/Fe] value from the dataset. In each panel, we consider stars in three different
            [Fe/H] bins, as indicated by the color of the lines. Within each bin, there are three
            sets of lines of identical colors: one created with the true age, one created with the
            predictions from the model trained on the fiducial dataset, one created with the
            predictions from the model trained on the dataset with chemical correlations removed.
            That is, each line is created from datapoints with the same [Mg/Fe] values, but differ
            in their ages (x-positions). Recalling that the outputs of our PRFR model are samples
            from a posterior, we can consider how taking different point estimates from the
            posterior can influence the predicted age-abundance trends. On the left, we consider
            random samples from the conditional age distributions (converted from the conditional
            mass distributions). On the right, we consider the mode from the conditional age
            distributions. We see that the observed trends are very similar between the different
            metallicity bins, and also between the two panels. In addition, the lines corresponding
            to the model predicted ages and the true ages agree well. This shows that in this test
            case where we are able to directly estimate the ages without proxying through chemical
            correlations, the predictions from the model—regardless of whether we take random
            samples (i.e., sample the entire posterior) or a summary statistic that traces the bulk
            of the distribution—we are able to accurately reproduce age-abundance trends. 6. RED
            CLUMP SAMPLE We repeat our entire analysis using an APOGEEmocked red clump sample of
            stars. We generate this dataset following the method described in Section 2, but using
            EEPs ranging from 631 to 707, corresponding to the core helium burning phase of a star’s
            lifetime. Figure 9 shows the red clump sample in parameter space. The overall
            distributions of [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H] in the red clump sample is identical to those in the
            Milky Way sample, but the log g and Teff values span a much smaller range. In
            particular, the log g range for the red clump sample, especially in the absence of
            observational noise, is extremely small, with most stars having log g ≈ 2.5. This
            particular sample is a test case where the information content coming from stellar
            evolution should be much lower, precisely due to the highly constrained range in values
            as explained above—in the limiting case, we would be using a constant as one of the
            variables, which should be totally uninformative. As a consequence, the model tries to
            learn to predict masses using the available chemical proxies, rather than only through
            stellar evolution. We stress, however, that it is indeed possible to use stellar
            evolution to predict masses for red clump stars; there is simply less stellar evolution
            information available.
